# Pampers-campaign

## ARM & Scalability

Our backend is containerized using a lightweight Node.js image (`node:20-alpine`) which supports ARM architectures out of the box (e.g., AWS Graviton instances, ARM-based MacBooks, and edge devices).

This means Pampers Campaign Copilot can be deployed on ARM-based cloud infrastructure to:
- reduce compute cost per campaign,
- improve performance per watt,
- and run closer to local markets in a scalable way.

Thanks to this, the same AI-powered campaign engine that drives Braze automation can efficiently support 20+ countries from ARM-optimized infrastructure.
